# Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined

[Download from LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25565-carnalitas-slavery-reimagined/)

A comprehensive rework of the Carnalitas slavery system aiming at improved balance and better integration with other aspects of the game. Now also compatible with AGOT via a compatibility mod.

The latest version is compatible with CK3 1.12.x and Carnalitas 2.5. If you are still on CK3 1.11.x, use [version 0.18.0](https://github.com/pharaox/carnalitas_x/releases/download/0.18.0/carnalitas_slavery_reimagined-0.18.0.zip) instead with Carnalitas 2.2.

The latest version of the CSR AGOT compatibility mod is compatible with CK3 1.12.x, Carnalitas 2.5, CSR 0.20.x, and AGOT 0.2.x. Use it with [Carnalitas AGOT Compatibility](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/32307-carnalitas-agot-compatibility/).

## Overview

[Carnalitas](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14207-carnalitas-unified-sex-mod-framework-for-ck3/) added a much-needed slavery system to CK3. While this is great in itself and the basics of the original system are solid, there are certain things that could be improved, perhaps due to Carnalitas ambition to be a "unified sex mod framework" rather than a well-balanced mod in its own right.

In particular:

* Slave prices don't correspond well to other aspects of the game, they are way to high with claims and way to low otherwise.
* The reasons behind the AI accepting or initiating slavery interactions are not convincing, and the AI never initiates some of them.
* It's not exactly easy for the player to find rulers willing to buy or sell slaves, and there are rather few slaves owned by the AI to begin with.
* *Enslave* is possible on free courtiers, which doesn't make much sense.
* Once a prisoner is converted to a slave, it's no longer possible to ransom him or her.
* Religious doctrines that govern whether owning slaves of certain faiths is considered a crime, shunned, or accepted, are not followed consistently when determining if someone should be enslaved, freed, bought, or seized.

In a nutshell, what you can do as a player is easily enslave a lot of people, sell any you don't need to the AI, and buy any you may fancy from the AI, while the AI mostly passively obliges. With mods such as [Carnalitas Slavery Expansion](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/21651-carnalitas-slavery-expansion/) you can also assign them "professions" for additional benefits. However, these are also human-only, the AI never assigns them. All of this undermines the realism and immersion, and makes the game both a lot easier and less interesting than it could be.

This mod introduces a redesigned slavery system, one aiming to better integrate slavery with other aspects of the game, make interacting with slaves and other rulers more interesting and rewarding, achieve a better game balance, enable more roleplaying options, and maintain a reasonable challenge for the player. It does this by reworking most of the slavery interactions, introducing some new ones, making slaves more desirable for council and court positions, adding slavery attitudes and slave-related events, and rebalancing or fixing many of the original effects and outcomes, while still maintaining compatibility with other Carnalitas features and other mods based on Carnalitas.

With this mod:

* The **AI competes actively** in obtaining and keeping the best slaves, and **evaluates them better** taking into account their skills, aptitudes, claims, attraction, age, price, current jobs and more when buying, selling, enslaving or freeing.
* **Slave prices** better reflect the actual usefulness of slaves.
* Slaves can be also **ransomed, gifted, or liberated**, and the AI will occasionally do it as well.
* It's much easier to find rulers willing to buy, sell, or ransom slaves via special **convenience interactions**.
* **Slavery doctrines** have a significant and consistent impact that better reflects their original meaning.
* Slaves can be assigned to (some, but not all) **council and court positions** for additional benefits, and the AI is fully capable of doing this as well. There are also new court positions reserved for slaves or former slaves, such as *Slave Concubine*, *Slave Eunuch* or *Mameluke Captain*, available depending on religion, culture, and government form.
* You can choose a **slavery attitude**, one of *Slaver*, *Liberator*, *Slave Trader*, or *Slave Employer* to get a minor modifier and a unique slavery-related perk. This unlocks additional roleplaying options for players and results in actual "human trafficking" when used by the AI.
* **Additional slaves** fit for specific occupations are spawned into the world via events. Useful characters are more likely to be captured (and then enslaved) instead of killed during raids and sieges.
* There are **slavery-related flavor events**, such as a slave running away, demands for a slave's freedom, etc. There are also hidden events for AI rulers to interact with their slaves in ways that were previously only available to the player, e.g. have sex with them.
* There are **fame traits** that add roleplaying flavor, such as the negative *Infamous Slaver* trait and the positive *Famous Liberator* trait.

All taken together, slaves are now genuinely useful to their owners, there is an actual demand for them conditioned by religion and culture, and this demand is satisfied by warfare, raiding, slave trade, and slave-related events. As a player, you can choose between many different ways to interact with the system to either roleplay or use it to your advantage, and it's more challenging and hopefully more interesting to do this.

## Compatibility

This mod requires [Carnalitas](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14207-carnalitas-unified-sex-mod-framework-for-ck3/) as a prerequisite (obviously). While it modifies the slavery system in a substantial way, it doesn't touch other Carnalitas features and should be compatible with all of them.

This mod also supports changing its game rules mid-game with the [Gamerule Gadget](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826829936) mod.

### Compatibility with Mods Based on Carnalitas

This mod should be compatible with all mods based on Carnalitas that don't modify the slavery system. Compatibility with the following mods has been explicitly verified, but most others should work as well:

* [Character Body Overhaul](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16683-character-body-overhaul/)
* [Physical Attributes](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/16927-physical-attributes/)

This mod may not be compatible with all other mods that modify the slavery system. However, it should still be compatible with mods that don't change the original Carnalitas slavery interactions, modifiers, or effects. Compatibility with the following mods has been explicitly verified:

* [Carnalitas Slavery Expansion](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/21651-carnalitas-slavery-expansion/).

### Compatibility with Total Conversion Mods

Due to its changes to vanilla files, this mod may conflict with changes done by total conversion mods. This is also true for Carnalitas itself. For best experience, such mods require compatibility patches for both Carnalitas and CSR.

CSR is now fully compatible with [A Game of Thrones](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2962333032) with [Carnalitas AGOT Compatibility](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/32307-carnalitas-agot-compatibility/) and a CSR AGOT compatibility patch available as a separate download.

If you still want to try using CSR with a different conversion mod, be prepared that some features might be broken. To make the best of it, follow these recommendations:

* Load Carnalitas and CSR **before** the total conversion mod. They overwrite a few vanilla files entirely, and if there are conflicts you would rather want the conversion mod overwrites, not the Carnalitas / CSR ones. Note that they also overwrite some specific vanilla objects, and will always do so, no matter the order.
* Change the *Universe* CSR game rule to *Fantasy*. This avoids errors for historical religions, cultures, and titles that may have been removed by the conversion mod. Note that there may still be errors for other removed vanilla objects that can't be clearly identified as "historical".

## Localization

This mod is currently available in English, Russian (translated by [@Undertalk](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/9955238-undertalk/)), Chinese (translated by [@Dark_Crow](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/10396935-dark_crow/)), and French (translated by [@don-vip](https://github.com/don-vip)).

## Features

### Buying and Selling Slaves

As in Carnalitas, slaves can be bought or sold via the *Buy Slave* and *Sell Slave* interactions. There are however substantial differences in how these interactions work in this mod.

#### Slave Prices

In this mod, slaves are bought and sold at prices that better correspond to the cost of recruiting guests. Most of the factors influencing the base price of a slave are the same as those influencing the cost of recruiting a guest, with similar impact, such as base, claims, dynasty prestige level, genetic, commander, and other traits, and skills. There are also some unique factors, such as attraction, visibly fertile female, and age. At the very end, a correction multiplier is applied to calculate the final base price, intended to prevent the player from making too much money from selling slaves.

Actual buy and sell transactions are settled at the *bid price* (buyer's price) if the initiating party is the seller, and the *ask price* (seller's price), if the initiating party is the buyer. These prices are calculated by multiplying the base price by a factor depending on AI greed, and an additional factor of 0.8 (for the bid price) or 1.2 (for the ask price) if the initiating party is the player. As a result, the player always buys at higher and sells at lower prices compared to the AI. This is done to prevent exploits, and to make it a bit more challenging for the player to use the trading system to their advantage.

Characters with the [*Slave Trader* attitude](#slavery-attitudes) get more favorable prices when buying and selling slaves. Currently, these prices are 10% lower when buying and 10% higher when selling.

#### AI Willingness to Buy or Sell

When buying slaves, the AI acceptance is influenced by a comprehensive estimation of the slave's usefulness based on factors such as:

* Is the slave better than other options available to the buyer as a councillor, court position (any of 17 existing and 3 new specific to slaves), knight, or commander, and how much better exactly.
* Does the slave have any useful claims on neighboring realms.
* Is the buyer attracted to the sex of the slave, and if yes the slave's attraction.
* Is the slave a visibly fertile female.
* The age of the slave, negative unless the slave is between 16 and 30 years of age.
* The slave price.
* The buyer's wealth.

When selling, the AI acceptance is influenced by similar factors, but working in the opposite direction. Factors such as the AI's opinion of the other party play a minor role, and dread plays no role at all. In addition, the AI will never offer to pay more than their "short term gold" (the portion of the AI's budget that can be used for short term purchases), and will only sell if the other party offers enough gold to pay the full price.

When deciding to initiate buying or selling of slaves, the AI is driven by much the same considerations. Unlike Carnalitas, AI rulers will attempt to both buy and sell slaves from / to other AI rulers (never the player).

All in all, the AI is in general quite reluctant to buy slaves who are useless, or sell slaves who are useful to them. As a player, you may find it impossible to find buyers for your slaves unless they have some of the useful qualities listed above. Still, for slaves whom nobody wants to buy, there are plenty of other options what to do with them. You could also spend a hook if you have one on a ruler and really want to buy or sell a slave.

#### Convenience Interactions for the Player

While it is possible to initiate buying or selling of slaves by right-clicking on a ruler, it may be quite hard to find rulers who are willing to buy one of your slaves, or sell some of their slaves to you. Furthermore, the price you get with each ruler may be different. To make it more convenient for the player, this mod introduces the following 2 new interactions:

* *Buy Slaves*: Buy a slave by choosing from a list of all slaves whom other rulers are willing to sell to you. If there are no such slaves, the list will be empty.
* *Sell Slaves*: Sell one of your slaves by choosing from a list of those of your slaves whom other rulers are willing to buy from you. If there are no such slaves, the list will be empty. After choosing a slave, you can choose a buyer from a list of other rulers who are willing to buy that slave from you. Since buyers can't be sorted by their bid prices, this list contains only a limited number of buyers offering the highest bid prices. This number is 5 by default and can be configured via the *Number of Potential Buyers* game rule.

#### Valid Buyers and Sellers

For added realism and also to improve performance on lower-end machines, whether a character is considered to be a valid buyer or seller is determined by the *Valid Buyers or Sellers* game rule. It has the following settings:

* *Same and Neighboring Realms*: Rulers in the same and neighboring realms (less buyers or sellers, better performance and realism).
* *Within Trading Range*: Rulers in the same and neighboring realms, and foreign rulers within a dynamic trading range depending on rank (smallest for counts, largest for emperors), measured as the distance between capitals. This is the default setting.
* *All Rulers*: All rulers within diplomatic range (more buyers or sellers, worse performance and realism).

The AI uses a slightly different version of the above due to engine limitations. Starting with version 0.5.0, AI rulers will attempt to precision target one valid buyer or seller per slave when selling slaves, to improve their chances to find a buyer.

### Enslaving and Seizing Prisoners

As in Carnalitas, prisoners can be enslaved via the *Enslave* interaction. Prisoners who are already someone else's slaves can be "seized" instead via the *Seize Slave* interaction.

Unlike Carnalitas, a person can only be enslaved if he or she is a prisoner. The *Enslave* interaction is not available on free courtiers. Since a prisoner doesn't really have a choice, both *Enslave* and *Seize Slave* interactions are accepted automatically.

When deciding to initiate enslaving or seizing of slaves, the AI is driven by considerations similar to the ones listed under [AI Willingness to Buy or Sell](#ai-willingness-to-buy-or-sell). In addition, factors such as AI compassion, greed, and their opinion of the prisoner also play a role. Unlike Carnalitas, the AI would not enslave a prisoner that should rather be executed (execution reason, rival / nemesis, unfaithful spouse, etc.), unless the prisoner survived for more than 2 years.

For added realism and to ensure the mod doesn't disrupt the original game balance, the *Enslave* interaction is balanced in such a way that only about 20% of all prisoners are actually enslaved by the AI. The rest are executed, ransomed, or simply released.

### Freeing, Liberating, and Ransoming Slaves

As in Carnalitas, slaves can be freed by their owners via the *Free Slave* interaction. In return the owner may ask for gold, conversion, renouncing of claims, a favor, or nothing. Prisoners who are someone else's slaves can be "liberated" instead via the new *Liberate Slave* interaction.

In this mod it is also possible to demand ransom for a slave from another ruler who is their relative, as well as offer ransom for a slave who is your relative, via the new *Demand Ransom for Slave* and *Offer Ransom for Slave* interactions. Characters with the [*Liberator* attitude](#slavery-attitudes) are also able to offer ransom for slaves of their own faith, even if they are not relatives.

When deciding to initiate freeing, liberating, demanding ransom, or offering ransom for slaves, the AI is driven by considerations similar to the ones listed under [AI Willingness to Buy or Sell](#ai-willingness-to-buy-or-sell). In addition, factors such as AI compassion, greed, and their opinion of the slave also play a role.

Note that the cost of freeing, liberating, or ransoming a slave is not their slave price, but their usual [ransom cost](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Court#Ransom_cost).

If you enslaved a prisoner instead of ransoming them, you may not be able to sell them to a relative since relatives get additional negative modifiers to their willingness to buy, and this may also be [penalized by slavery doctrines](#impact-of-slavery-doctrines), but you would still be able to demand ransom from one of their relatives. Similarly, if someone enslaved one of your relatives, you may not be able to buy them, but you would still be able to offer ransom to their owner.

#### Convenience Interactions for the Player

Starting with version 0.13.0, this mod introduces convenience interactions also for demanding and offering ransom for slaves, similar to the ones for buying and selling slaves:

* *Offer Ransom for Slaves*: Offer ransom for a slave by choosing from a list of all slaves whom you can ransom and whose owners are willing to accept your offer. If there are no such slaves, the list will be empty.
* *Demand Ransom for Slaves*: Demand ransom for one of your slaves by choosing from a list of those of your slaves whom other rulers are able and willing to ransom. If there are no such slaves, the list will be empty.

### Gifting Slaves

In this mod, a slave can also be gifted to another ruler for an opinion gain via the new *Gift Slave* interaction. The opinion gain is proportional to the slave base price and to the "gift opinion / gift value" ratio of the *Send Gift* vanilla interaction. AI rulers are much more likely to accept slaves as gifts than to buy them.

### Demanding Manumission

As in Carnalitas, you can demand the freedom of all slaves owned against religious doctrines from one of your vassals via the *Demand Manumission* interaction. The recipient can accept or decline the demand, or ask for gold or a favor in return.

Starting with version 0.15.0, this interaction has been changed from its Carnalitas version to better reflect the nature of the demand, instead of mostly copying the *Demand Conversion* vanilla interaction. The most important changes are:

* You can only demand manumission from vassals of your own faith.
* Declining the interaction is not considered a crime (and so does not grant you an imprisonment reason), unless you have the [*Liberator* attitude](#slavery-attitudes).
* The amount of gold that the recipient may ask for is proportional to the number of slaves being freed.
* The AI acceptance is influenced by their personality and slavery attitude, as well as the difference between your and their diplomacy and learning skills.
* The AI is much less willing to initiate the interaction than before, since they don't have much to gain from it, unless they are a *Liberator*. This willingness is influenced by their personality and slavery attitude, as well as the chance of acceptance.

For the purposes of acquiring the *Liberator* trait, the slaves freed by the *Demand Manumission* interaction are considered freed by the recipient only if they accepted the interaction without asking for anything in return. If they asked for something and the actor accepted, the slaves are considered freed by the actor.

### Impact of Slavery Doctrines

Carnalitas introduces the *Slavery Crime* and *Slavery Shunned* religious doctrines that determine whether owning slaves of certain faiths is considered a crime, shunned, or accepted, depending on the faith's hostility level. However, in Carnalitas these doctrines are not followed consistently when determining the consequences of slavery interactions, or the AI willingness to initiate or accept them. This mod attempts to correct this by rebalancing the impact of slavery doctrines on all slavery interactions:

* If owning slaves of a certain faith is a crime, for adherents of this faith:
  * Although it is possible to enslave them, this is penalized by gaining one of the [leveled *Slaver* traits](#leveled-slaver-traits), as well as losing a level of fame.
  * Initiating or accepting most interactions (except freeing or ransoming) has a major piety cost.
  * The AI will be very unwilling to initiate enslave, seize, sell, buy, or gift interactions for them.
  * The AI will also be very unwilling to accept sell, buy, or gift interactions for them.
  * The AI will be quite willing to free, liberate, demand ransom, or offer ransom for them.
* If owning slaves of a certain faith is shunned, for adherents of this faith:
  * Although it is possible to enslave them, this is penalized by gaining one of the [leveled *Slaver* traits](#leveled-slaver-traits), as well as losing piety.
  * Initiating or accepting most interactions (except freeing or ransoming) has a minor piety cost.
  * The AI will be quite unwilling to initiate enslave, seize, sell, buy, or gift interactions for them.
  * The AI will be also be quite unwilling to accept sell, buy, or gift interactions for them.
  * The AI will be somewhat more willing to free, liberate, demand ransom, or offer ransom for them.

The actual impact of slavery doctrines on the AI willingness to initiate or slavery accept interactions also depends on the AI zeal, ranging from 150% for very zealous characters to 50% for very cynical ones.

In addition, owning slaves against religious doctrines leads to yearly [piety loss](#piety-loss-from-slaves).

### Council and Court Positions

Starting with version 0.4.0, this mod integrates the slavery system also with council and court positions. The overall idea is somewhat similar to the "slave professions" in the Slavery Expansion mod, but using court positions has a number of advantages - they are much more sophisticated, the AI can take full advantage of them, they can be restricted by religion, culture, and government type, etc.

#### New Slave Court Positions

This mod introduces 3 new court positions that are reserved for slaves or former slaves conferring somewhat lesser but still tangible advantages:

* *Slave Concubine*: diplomacy / attraction, restricted to polygamous religions and cultures, gives court grandeur and prestige (5 positions)
* *Mameluke Captain*: martial / prowess, restricted to clan governments, gives court grandeur and knights effectiveness (3 positions)
* *Slave Eunuch*: stewardship / intrigue, restricted to polygamous religions and cultures and cultures that can appoint *Chief Eunuch*, gives court grandeur, development growth, and hostile scheme resistance (3 positions)

Any children of *Slave Concubines* are no longer slaves and have their correct father, house, dynasty, faith, and culture, including effects of dynasty perks.

Note that only slaves, but not former slaves, can be appointed to slave court positions. If a slave holding a court position is freed, they retain the position, however if it's revoked they can't be appointed to it again.

#### Changes to Existing Council and Court Positions

This mod divides the existing council and court positions into ones that are available to slaves (always or only for certain government forms), and ones that are not available to slaves at all.

The following 17 court positions are available to slaves: *Court Physician*, *Antiquarian*, *Court Gardener*, *Wet Nurse*, *Court Tutor*, *Food Taster*, *Seneschal*, *Cupbearer*, *Chief Eunuch*, *Court Jester*, *Court Poet*, *Court Musician*, *Bodyguard*, *Personal Champion*, *Executioner*, *Master Assassin*, and *Chronicler*. The rest of the court positions are not available to slaves, because they are considered either ceremonial (reserved for vassals to make them happy) or religious, or are subject to certain game limitations.

The following 4 council positions are available to slaves: *Chancellor*, *Steward*, *Marshal*, and *Spymaster*. The *Court Chaplain* council position is not available to slaves, since it is considered religious. The *Vizier* council position (added in CK3 1.11) is also not available to slaves, since it is reserved for diarchs and spouses. Note that *Chancellor*, *Steward*, and *Marshal* are only available to slaves if your government is clan or tribal, to reflect the fact that historically such important roles were held by slaves only if they were considered more loyal than other available options, which was the case in certain Muslim and tribal societies. They are also available to characters with the [*Slave Employer* attitude](#slavery-attitudes).

Once a slave is assigned to a court position, he or she is paid a reduced salary (50%, or 25% for characters with [*Slave Employer* attitude](#slavery-attitudes)) and has an increased opinion gain (3x) compared to other courtiers. AI rulers are therefore more likely to appoint slaves to court positions.

When evaluating slaves for buying, selling, enslaving, etc., the AI considers their fitness for all these positions. Slaves that are evaluated as useful usually end up actually being used (employed in a council or court position) by the AI.

In addition, if Carnalitas lactation is enabled, the milk production amount is taken into account for the *Wet Nurse* court position aptitude.

### Capturing Slaves during Raids and Sieges

With this mod, characters who can be enslaved and have a base price higher than a threshold are now captured instead of killed during raids and sieges. This threshold is lower for characters with the [*Slaver* attitude](#slavery-attitudes). In addition, characters captured during a raid have 50% chance of getting the "marked for enslavement" modifier, which makes enslavement by the AI more likely. This increases the number of characters enslaved as a result of warfare or raiding.

### Slavery Attitudes

Starting with version 0.13.0, this mod introduces *slavery attitudes*. You can choose a slavery attitude via the *Choose Slavery Attitude* decision to get a minor modifier and a unique slavery-related perk. There are 4 slavery attitudes:

* *Slaver*: This character likes enslaving prisoners and selling them to willing buyers.
  * Minor prestige penalty and dread decay bonus
  * More likely to capture rather than kill characters during sieges and raids
  * AI rulers more willing to enslave, seize, and sell and less willing to free, liberate, buy, ransom, and gift
* *Liberator*: This character likes freeing, liberating, and ransoming slaves.
  * Minor prestige bonus and dread decay penalty
  * Can pay ransom for slaves of their own faith, even if they are not relatives
  * Gets an imprisonment reason on vassals who decline to free their illegal slaves.
  * AI rulers more willing to free, liberate, and ransom and less willing to enslave, seize, buy, sell, and gift
* *Slave Trader*: This character tries to make profit from buying and selling slaves.
  * Minor development growth bonus and stress gain penalty
  * Gets more favorable prices when buying and selling slaves
  * AI rulers more willing to enslave, seize, buy, and sell and less willing to free, liberate, and gift
* *Slave Employer*: This character likes employing slaves since he considers them more loyal.
  * Minor tax bonus and popular opinion penalty
  * Can employ slaves in additional occupations and for lower salaries
  * AI rulers more willing to enslave, seize, and buy and less willing to free, liberate, sell, and gift

Slavery attitudes are mainly intended to enable additional roleplaying options for the player, but can also be chosen by the AI. Only about 10% to 20% of AI rulers will ever choose an attitude, the rest will remain "neutral". The likelihood of AI choosing a certain attitude is heavily influenced by their religion and government form, as well as their personality. Tribal and pagan rulers tend to choose *Slaver*, feudal and Christian rulers prefer *Liberator* or *Slave Trader*, clan and Muslim rulers tend to choose *Slave Employer*, and republics usually opt for *Slave Trader*.

One intended and historically accurate outcome of this is that it results in actual "human trafficking" of slaves from realms where they are more easily created (tribal realms with a pagan religion) to realms where they are more in demand (clan and feudal realms with an abrahamic religion).

### Traits

#### Slaver and Liberator Fame Traits

Starting with version 0.9.0, this mod adds two new fame traits, *Infamous Slaver* and *Famous Liberator*.

* *Infamous Slaver* is a fame trait that adds negative diplomacy, prestige, MAA maintenance, and general opinion, and positive dread multipliers. It is acquired via an [event](#trait-events) after enslaving a certain number of people, usually between 20 and 30.
* *Famous Liberator* is a fame trait that adds positive diplomacy, prestige, MAA maintenance, and general opinion, and negative dread multipliers. It is acquired via an [event](#trait-events) after freeing, liberating, or ransoming a certain number of people, usually between 20 and 30.

These traits represent consequences of "bad" and "good" behavior towards slaves. They are intended to further improve the balance and add some roleplaying flavor for the player. Although the AI also actively enslaves, frees, sells, and buys slaves, it is very unlikely to reach the numbers required for acquiring one of these traits. They are independent of the [slavery attitudes](#slavery-attitudes) described above, but choosing the *Slaver* or *Liberator* attitude certainly makes acquiring the corresponding trait easier.

#### Leveled Slaver Traits

Starting with version 0.18.0, this mod adds a leveled *Slaver* fame trait. The 2 levels are *Slaver (Hostile Faith)* and *Slaver (Righteous Faith)*. They are acquired automatically after enslaving someone against [slavery doctrines](#impact-of-slavery-doctrines) depending on whether their faith is considered hostile / evil or righteous / astray. They add negative opinion to all adherents of the enslaver's faith, and may add an imprisonment reason as well if owning such characters as slaves is considered a crime.

### Slavery Events

#### Buy Foreign Slaves

Slave traders bring two slaves for sale and you can buy one of them. The slaves are of faith and culture that is different from yours, and never of faith that falls under the *Slavery Crime* doctrine. One of the slaves has skills / traits that make him or her a better fit for a particular occupation, for the other one they are generated completely at random.

Besides adding flavor, this event also spawns more slaves than would normally exist if the only way to create them was to enslave prisoners. It fires approximately every 5 years for every ruler of rank count and above. The AI will mostly not buy, unless it considers one of the slaves really useful according to the factors described in [AI Willingness to Buy or Sell](#ai-willingness-to-buy-or-sell).

#### Runaway Slave

One of your slaves flees, taking some of your valuables with them, and a knight is chosen as a scapegoat. You can try to catch the slave via intrigue or martial challenges, fine or forgive the scapegoat, or do nothing, for a loss or gain of prestige or stress.

This event is based on the *Escaped Thrall* event from FP1, but is somewhat more sophisticated as it involves a real character. It fires approximately every 10 years for every ruler who is a slave owner.

#### Freedom for a Slave

Your Court Chaplain demands the freedom of one of your slaves because your faith does not permit owning slaves of their faith. You can free the slave, make a money donation, or ignore the demand for a loss of piety.

This event fires approximately every 2 years for every ruler that owns eligible slaves.

#### AI Rulers Having Sex with Their Slaves

AI rulers may have sex with one of their slaves (or former slaves who are also *Slave Concubines*) once a year if they are attracted to them, via a hidden event. The chance of pregnancy is dynamic with an average of 20%.

This event will fire also for the player if the *Make Love* interaction is disabled. If the *Make Love* interaction is enabled, the event will not fire, since the player is then expected to make love to their slaves and *Slave Concubines*. The chance of pregnancy for the *Make Love* interaction is hardcoded at 30%, as in the original Carnalitas.

#### Piety Loss From Slaves

Once a year rulers may lose piety for any slaves owned against religious doctrines, via a hidden event. The piety lost per slave is:

* 25 if owning slaves of their faith is shunned by your faith.
* 50 if owning slaves of their faith is considered a crime by your faith.

#### Trait Events

* Every time you enslave someone, you may acquire the [*Infamous Slaver* trait](#traits) via the *Infamous Slaver* event. The chance is 5% after 10 times, 10% after 20, and so on.
* Every time you free or ransom someone not originally enslaved by you, you may acquire the [*Famous Liberator* trait](#traits) via the *Famous Liberator* event. The chance is 5% after 10 times, 10% after 20, and so on.

### Slave Memories

Being enslaved, freed, bought, ransomed, seized, liberated, or gifted is certainly a significant lifetime event from the slave's perspective. This mod adds character memories for all these events in the slave's memory book.

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs present in Carnalitas have been fixed in this mod:

* Slaves can no longer leave their owner's court to become wanderers. If a slave leaves their owners court for whatever reason, they are returned automatically.
* If a slave owner dies and their heir doesn't inherit their court (e.g. because they have their own court), slaves don't just wander off similarly to other courtiers, but are instead added to the court of their new owner.
* If a slave owner stops being a ruler, their slaves are seized by the new title holder of their last title. Non-rulers owning slaves is problematic because they are not under AI control and their slaves can never be freed, ransomed, or traded.
* Enslaved concubines are properly "divorced".

## Vanilla Changes

* The *Invite to Court*, *Take Vows*, and *Dismiss* vanilla interactions, as well as the *Banish*, *Take Vows*, and *Recruit* options of the *Negotiate Release* interaction are not available on slaves since they are returned automatically to their owners court. To dismiss or banish a slave, they should be freed first.
* The *Demand Payment* vanilla interaction is no longer available on slaves since using it on slaves can be considered an exploit.
* Slaves can be imprisoned without incurring tyranny, and can also be released from prison without losing dread.
* Slaves are less likely to be converted to their owner's faith compared to other courtiers. This is mostly to prevent them to be freed too quickly as a result of the rebalanced impact of slavery doctrines.

## Changes to Carnalitas

The sections below list the changes made to existing Carnalitas objects in somewhat more detail for easier checking of compatibility with other mods.

### Interactions (`character_interactions`)

* *Buy Slave* (`carn_buy_slave_directly_interaction`): Modified as described above. If accepted, the slave is bought at the seller's price (`carnx_slave_ask_price_value`), not `carn_slave_price_value`.
* *Sell Slave* (`carn_sell_slave_interaction`): Modified as described above. If accepted, the slave is sold at the buyers's price (`carnx_slave_bid_price_value`), not `carn_slave_price_value`.
* *Enslave* (`carn_enslave_interaction`): Modified as described above.
* *Free Slave* (`carn_free_slave_interaction`): Modified as described above.
* *Seize Slave* (`carn_seize_slave_interaction`): Modified as described above. Added triggering of the `carnx_on_slave_seized` on-action.

### Triggers (`scripted_triggers`)

* `carn_possible_pregnancy_after_sex_with_character_trigger`: Changed usages of `effective_age` to `carnx_age_value` to make sure that the age can be properly overridden by compatibility submods.
* `carn_relationship_allows_free_sex_trigger`: Enabled free sex with former slaves that are also your *Slave Concubines*.
* `carn_gender_can_impregnate_trigger`: Prevented eunuchs from impregnating, and also from getting Carnalitas DT traits.

### Effects (`scripted_effects`)

* `carn_enslave_effect`: Rebalanced (mainly slightly lowered) dread, tyranny, piety, and stress effects that were originally copied from the *Execute* interaction. Removed the removal of the slave's gold (it didn't work anyway and was reported in `errors.log`). Changed some tooltips.
* `carn_free_slave_effect`: Added a safety check to prevent errors in `carn_on_slave_freed`.
* `carn_free_slave_interaction_effect`: Rebalanced dread and piety effects. If asked for gold, the slave pays their ransom cost (`carnx_slave_ransom_cost_value`) instead of `carn_slave_price_value`.
* `carn_buy_slave_effect`: Changed interface messages and tooltips. Added triggering of the `carnx_on_slave_bought` on-action.

### On Action (`on_action`)

* `on_death_relation_slave`: Fixed some of the bugs mentioned in [Bug Fixes](#bug-fixes)

### Other

* The value `carn_slave_price_value` is no longer used by any interactions or effects. It has been replaced by other values, mainly `carnx_slave_bid_price_value` and `carnx_slave_ask_price_value`.
* The character and trait flags `carn_wants_to_be_a_slave` and the opinion modifier `carn_wants_to_be_your_slave_opinion` are no longer used by any interactions. They are intended to work with the `carn_slavery_content_consensual_only` game rule that is not supported.

## Changes to Vanilla

The sections below list the changes made to existing vanilla objects in somewhat more detail for easier checking of compatibility with other mods.

### Interactions (`character_interactions`)

* `ask_for_conversion_courtier_interaction`: Reduced the chance of a slave being converted to their owner's faith to prevent freeing most slaves a few years after they were enslaved or bought.
* `release_from_prison_interaction`: Disabled the *Banish* option, as well as dread and stress impact for slaves.
* `demand_payment_interaction`: Disabled the *Demand Payment* interaction for slaves.

### Council Positions (`council_positions`)

* `00_council_positions.txt`: Changed triggers and effects of the *Chancellor*, *Steward*, *Marshal*, and *Spymaster* council positions to check their eligibility for slaves and log receiving and revoking the positions. Changed the trigger for the *Court Chaplain* council position to ensure that it's not eligible for slaves.

### Court Positions (`court_positions`)

* `00_court_positions.txt`: Changed conditions, effects, salaries, and aptitudes for may court positions, as described in [Changes to Existing Council and Court Positions](#changes-to-existing-council-and-court-positions).

### Triggers (`scripted_triggers`)

* `desirable_for_capture_trigger`: Made characters with a slave price above a certain threshold desirable for capture, ensuring that they are captured instead of killed during sieges and raids.
* `court_position_does_not_already_have_a_job_trigger`: Added *Slave Eunuch* and *Mameluke Captain* court positions to the list of "jobs".
* `can_recruit_character_to_court_trigger`: Disabled the *Invite to Court* interaction for slaves.
* `kick_from_court_validity_trigger`: Disabled the *Dismiss* interaction for slaves.

### Effects (`scripted_effects`)

* `prisoner_of_war_capture_effect`: Added marking a certain percentage of characters captured during raids with a special modifier that increases their chance to be enslaved by the AI.
* `imprison_tyranny_effect`: Ensured slaves can be imprisoned without gaining tyranny.

### Modifiers (`scripted_modifiers`)

* `hostile_murder_agent_base_join_chance_modifier`: Made vengeful characters more willing to join schemes against the person who originally enslaved them.

### Values (`script_values`)

* `raid_base_capture_chance`: Changed the scope for checking traits and dynasty perks from the character being captured to the army commander (vanilla bug).
